# Agent Instructions for the docs/ Directory

This directory contains all user-facing documentation for the `Actual_Tools` project, built and rendered with MkDocs. The goal is to provide clear, concise, and accurate information to help users and developers understand and use the toolkit effectively.

When contributing to the documentation, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Writing Style and Tone:**
    *   **Clarity is Key:** Write in clear and simple language. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it if it's necessary.
    *   **Concise:** Be brief and to the point.
    *   **Consistent Tone:** Maintain a professional and helpful tone throughout the documentation.

2.  **Structure and Formatting:**
    *   **Markdown:** All documentation is written in Markdown. Please adhere to standard Markdown syntax.
    *   **File Organization:** The `docs/` directory is organized into subdirectories based on content (e.g., `getting-started/`, `api/`, `examples/`). Place new documents in the most relevant location.
    *   **Navigation:** When adding a new page, ensure it is linked in the appropriate section of the `mkdocs.yml` file in the root of the repository to make it accessible.

3.  **Code Examples:**
    *   Provide code examples that are simple, executable, and clearly illustrate the concept being explained.
    *   Use Markdown code blocks with the correct language identifier (e.g., `python`) for syntax highlighting.

4.  **Review Process:**
    *   Before submitting any changes, proofread your writing for spelling and grammar errors.
    *   Build the documentation locally (`mkdocs serve`) to preview your changes and ensure everything renders correctly.

By adhering to these guidelines, you help ensure our documentation remains a high-quality, valuable resource for everyone.
